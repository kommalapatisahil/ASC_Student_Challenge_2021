# ASC_Student_Challenge_2021
Submission for ASC student challenge (2021)

The goal of this challenge is to design new and optimal cure cycles to manufacture sandwich composite structures. 

The data set contains 1800 rows with 12 inputs and 7 outputs. 

The relationship between the inputs and the outputs is learned using random forests owing to their interpretability and efficiency of handling inputs spanned in discrete space. 

After the model is learned, optimal cure cycles are designed by developing an optimization framework using SciPy's dual annealing optimization process. 

Keywords: discrete space optimization, random forests, global optimization methods, dual annealing, optimal cure cycle design.
